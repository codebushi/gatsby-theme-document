# Gatsby Theme Minimal Example

A usage of
[gatsby-theme-docs](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-theme-docs)
that does nothing but use the theme. As a result you will see `Error: Missing resources for /` when navigating to `localhost:8000`. To get
rid of that, create a page in `src/pages/index.js`.
