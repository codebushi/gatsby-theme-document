Welcome to Document, a Gatsby.js theme by [Code Bushi](https://codebushi.com). Quickly and easily create documentation for anything using MDX or Markdown.

👀 [View the Live Demo](https://gatsby-theme-document.netlify.com/)

## Getting Started

Using the Gatsby CLI

```bash
gatsby new document-site https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-theme-document-example
cd document-site
gatsby develop
```

Your new site will be up at http://localhost:8000

Try changing the logo by editing the file at `src/gatsby-theme-document/logo.mdx`.

## Adding Content

Document is built with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). Content can be added by creating or editing the MDX files in the content folder `content/index.mdx`.

With MDX, you can add JSX or even React components to your markdown files. Images can also be added to any `.mdx` file, and will be automatically optimized using [gatsby-remark-images](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-images/).

### Left Sidebar

The left sidebar navigation is automatically populated by the pages in the content folder. To sort the top level navigation, edit the `forcedNavOrder` option in the `gatsby-config.js` file.

The logo will link to the `index.mdx` page. To make the `index.mdx` page visible in the left navigation, set `ignoreIndex` to `false`.

Sub navigation items are created by making a folder with the same name as the top level `.mdx` file. The sub navigation is ordered alphabetically.

### Right Sidebar

The contents of the right sidebar will be automatically populated by any heading tags `h1, h2, h3, etc.` that are added to the page. They will anchor link to the corresponding heading.

## Theme Colors

Document is also built with [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com). The icon in the top right of the site will cycle through the various color modes that are available.

To edit or add colors modes, edit the file at `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/colors.js`. To learn more about color modes, check out the [Theme UI docs](https://theme-ui.com/color-modes).

The contents of the MDX files are also styled with Theme UI and can be edited at `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`. The styles for the heading tags are found at `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/headingsjs`. Learn more about [styling MDX](https://theme-ui.com/styling-mdx) from the Theme UI docs.

## Syntax Colors

Document uses [@theme-ui/prism](https://theme-ui.com/prism) for syntax highlighting. Different presets can be used by editing the file at `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js`. The desired preset must be included at the top of the file and spread into the `pre` styles

```javascript
import dracula from '@theme-ui/prism/presets/dracula.json';

styles: {
  pre: {
    ...dracula,
  }
}
```

The code blocks will not change color based on the color modes. For a complete list of all available prism presets, check out the Theme UI [syntax themes](https://theme-ui.com/prism#syntax-themes).

## Social Media Icons

The social media icons in the header can be edited in the `gatsby-config.js` file, under social. Currently, you can only add Twitter and Github links.
